    "Throughout this class we will use a consumption-saving problem as our main application. We start with a simple version with no idiosyncratic or aggregate uncertainty and no deterministic variation in income or interest rates. We assume standard regularity conditions on the utility function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The utility function is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sup_{\\{c_{t}\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}}\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\beta^t u(c_{t}) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "The per-period budget constraint is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a_{t} = (1+ r)a_{t-1} + y - c_t \\qquad \\forall t\\ge 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Initial wealth $a_{-1}$ is given.\n",

    "#### Sequence Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence problem is:\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "It is what it says on the tin: our goal is to find the sequence $\\{x_{t}\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}$ that solves this problem.\n",

    "#### Why do we use the Bellman Equation?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In deterministic applications the difference between a sequence and a function is not particularly important.\n",
    "2. With uncertainty, one sequence for each set of outcomes. Impossible to calculate one-by-one. So we need to find functional solutions to the sequence problem anyway.\n",
    "3. The Bellman Equation efficiently exploits the regularity in standard economic problems and allows to apply the Contraction Mapping Theorem.\n"
