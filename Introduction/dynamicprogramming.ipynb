    "Throughout this class we will use a consumption-saving problem as our main application. We start with a simple version with no idiosyncratic or aggregate uncertainty and no deterministic variation in income or interest rates. We assume standard regularity conditions on the utility function. \n",

    "The utility function is:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. In deterministic applications the difference between a sequence and a function is not particularly important.\n",
    "2. With uncertainty, a different sequence is a solution for different realization of the shocks. This is impossible to calculate one-by-one. So we need to find a functional solution to the sequence problem anyway.\n",
    "3. The Bellman Equation efficiently exploits the regularity in standard economic problems and allows to apply the Contraction Mapping Theorem.\n"
